# Planned analyses

<v-clicks>

- trends
  - geographic
  - chronologic
  - topologic
  - ontologic
  - biographic
- disparities
  - e.g. overlay maps of the disease itself (incidence, morbidity, etc.) and research about that disease
- funding/resource allocation
    - link with National Clinical Trial number (NCT)

</v-clicks>

---

# Next steps

- finalize data structure
- rewrite web scraper
- redundant data storage
- analyses (interactive)
- automatic updates
- abstract submission to ASCO (Feb 2024), ASH (Aug 2024)
- manuscript (mid 2024)

# Mentorship committee

## Clinical Mentors

- Dr Jennifer Choe (HN)
- Dr Mike Gibson (HN/UGI)
- alternate clinics

<br>

## Research Mentors

- Dr Travis Osterman (primary, local, EMR, structured pt journeys)
    - 1:1 meetings at least monthly
- Dr Jeremy Warner (second primary, abroad, HemOnc.org, ontology)
    - 1:1 meetings at least q2mo
- Dr Josh Peterson (Directer, Center for Precision Medicine, sequencing across large populations, clinical decision support)
    - hope to meet soon

---

# Other current projects

- multiomics for sarcoma (PI: Osterman)
- extreme biometry database (validated extremes in lab and radiographic parameters, to be used for data cleaning and exploration)

---

# Future directions in fellowship

## Goal 1: Develop clinical expertise in HN/UGI

<br>

## Goal 2: Develop funding sources

<br>

- early/training awards - e.g. [T15](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html)
- later awards - e.g. [ITCR](https://itcr.cancer.gov/about-itcr) U01, U24, etc.

   [Biomedical Knowledgebase](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-097.html)

<br>

## Goal 3: ?Pursue clinical informatics fellowship


<br>

- -> MS-ACI [21mo program]
- r/b discussion ongoing (e.g. qualify for T15, opportunity cost)
