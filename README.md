# Talks

Talks I plan to give
or gave in the past.
The presentations are generated with [Slidev][slidev]
and published by GitHub actions to Netlify, accessible through my [website][website].

## Authors

Many thanks to [Anthony Fu][antfu] for the core,
and [Thomas Boerger][tboerger]
for figuring out how to piece things together for a sane workflow.
